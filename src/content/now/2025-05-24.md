I'm in the middle of my spring semester exams, and as I have had a lot of work so far this year, both in my studies and at work, I'm getting a bit burned out on energy.

So this is a perfect time to start a procrastination side-project :D see where this weekend takes me.

I have had a personal website for a while now, but it has been quite basic in regard to features.
My friend Malachi has been asking me to try **Svelte** for a while now, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to try it out.
It's also an opportunity to try out "vibe coding" by having JetBrains' [Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/) help me convert my Next.js project to Astro and Svelte, both technologies I have never worked with.

Besides that, really just enjoying life. Lots of cosy social events, got great coffee on lock, and I'm looking forward to the summer with festivals, concerts, and great weather.
