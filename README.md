## How to set up and run this locally

1. Create a `.env` with the following elements seen in the [.env.example](https://github.com/banner4422/personal-website/blob/master/.env.example) file
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

## Spotify authorization

The footer reads the site owner's currently playing track with Spotify's Authorization Code
flow. Add this exact redirect URI to the app in the Spotify Developer Dashboard:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
```

Spotify refresh tokens expire six months after authorization. To authorize the account and
replace both the local token and the production Cloudflare secret, run:

```bash
npm run spotify:authorize
```

The command opens Spotify sign-in, saves the resulting refresh token to the ignored `.env`, and
publishes it to Cloudflare through Wrangler. It never prints the token. Use `--local-only` to skip
Cloudflare publication, or `--publish-only` to retry publishing the token already stored in
`.env`.

If production receives Spotify's `invalid_grant` response, it stops retrying that token, renders
the normal “Not Playing” footer state, and writes a `spotify_reauthorization_required` event to
the Worker logs. Run the command above to restore the integration.
